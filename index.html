        <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>CogMon is a real-time reporting software for analyzing time-based data series - like business process performance statistics, KPIs, web site activity, hardware performance statistics and any other parameters that change with time. CogMon offers an extensible, user-customizable web GUI for viewing the reports, building one's own dashboards and constructing new types of reports.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>CogMon is a .Net application. It requires ASP.Net MVC 3, Microsoft.Net 4.0 and a Windows operating system. Data is stored in MongoDB database.
There were no attempts to run CogMon on Mono/Linux.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>CogMon collects data by polling data sources in regular intervals. Data source returns a sample containing current values of monitored parameters. Samples are stored in CogMon database and are used for calculating statistics, which are then shown in the reporting GUI.
CogMon has two methods of storing and processing the data. First one is based on the rrdtool utility, which is a all-in-one round-robin database management tool with graph drawing functionality. Another one is based on MongoDB database and custom map-reduce functions for data aggregation. The latter is more difficult and complicated to set up, but can be used for complex data processing.</p>

<h3>Why not Cacti</h3>

<p>There are several network/hardware monitoring tools based on rrdtool, Cacti being the most popular among them. CogMon is based on the same ideas (round-robin database, polling) but is less focused on IT infrastructure monitoring and targeted mainly to 'business' users.</p>

<h3>What kinds of information can be collected</h3>

<p>Any numeric parameter that changes in time and that can be queried for current value can be monitored. There are many methods of collecting the data: http text/json/xml request, SQL query, text file parsing, windows performance counters API and custom scripts. </p>

<h3>How does the GUI look like and what reports are available?</h3>
