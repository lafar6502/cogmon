It requires ASP.Net MVC 3, Microsoft.Net 4.0 and a Windows operating system. Data is stored in MongoDB database.\r\nThere were no attempts to run CogMon on Mono/Linux.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nData is collected by querying various data sources for current values of monitored parameters in regular intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes) \r\n\r\n### Why not Cacti\r\nCacti is targeted for hardware/network infrastructure monitoring and lacks some features important for non-IT users.\r\n\r\n### What kinds of information can be collected\r\nAny numeric parameter that can be queried for current value can be monitored.\r\n\r\n### What reports are available\r\n\r\n### ","google":"UA-34686084-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
